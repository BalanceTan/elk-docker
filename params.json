And each of ELK stack componets was running in a docker container.\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n============\r\n\r\nAll containers are organized by ``docker-compose`` . For these containers were linked by each other, containers could not separated to different hosts.\r\n\r\nHow ever, you may change the configuration files and make it running separately on a cluster.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n===========\r\n\r\n* rsyslog - this directory contains rsyslog configurations which let rsyslog on openstack-node read openstack logs and tranport to logstash.\r\n\r\n* logstash_patterns - a collection of grok patterns that help logstash's filter to parse openstask's logs.\r\n\r\n* all configuration files are volumes that mounted to containers. So change them to make you feel cool !\r\n\r\n* the base images used by this project can be found in hub.docker.com. They are offical base images of course.\r\n\r\n**If you have problems with this project, please create an issue. And we need your pull requests! Thanks!**\r\n\r\n**DOCKERS ARE COOL**\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
